Developed on Prof. Dehne's Virtual Machine in c++.

The given input files are located in the ins/ directory.
The given output files are located in the outs/ directory.

If you would like to run the program and execute all tests as well, simply open a bash shell to the directory that _run is located and execute './_run'.

_run will compile the program, process inputs 1 through 5, and check all of the processed output files with Prof. Dehne's given output files.

The _run command will store all of the outputs that it generates in the processed-outs/ directory. I will delete all files in the processed-outs/ directory prior to submitting my assignment. Please check to make sure there are no files in the processed-out directory before executing _run. This will not cause any errors if there are files, but will show you that files are being correctly generated, and are not simply copies of the professors sample outputs. 

If you would like to manually execute the program in a bash shell opened in the main.cpp directory, execute ./_compile then execute ./main in the format './main <input file location> <output file location>. If you make a mistake the program will print out print out an error and tell you how to format your command again.

To compare files execute in bash 'diff <file1> <file2>'. _run will compare all 5 outputs for you after it has processed the data.
